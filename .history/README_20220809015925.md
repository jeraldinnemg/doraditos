## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge mostly focuses on HTML, CSS and JavaScript using FullPageJs libary.

The users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. I think as a developer is also important to know how libraries of languages works, read the documentation and understand what is behind to get better results.

By the way I designed the branding of Doraditos, the logo and all mood of this little entreprenuship of venezuelan food.
